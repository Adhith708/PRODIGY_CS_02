# Simple Image Encryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption tool implemented in Python that uses basic pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. The tool allows users to swap pixel values and apply a mathematical operation to each pixel, providing a basic level of image encryption.

## Features

- Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
- Decrypt images back to their original form.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adhith708/image-encryption-tool.git
   cd image-encryption-tool
